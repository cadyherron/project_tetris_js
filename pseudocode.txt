grid of div's with data-x and data-y

$('div').hasClass('filled')

=========================
board model: (knows about all pieces)

- 10 blocks wide, 20 blocks high
- 4 hidden rows at the top of the screen where pieces are built
- pieces stop moving when they touch another piece or the ground
- row gets cleared when it's full of non-moving pieces


array of empty spaces to check if moves are valid?


piece types:
- 2x2 squares
- 4x1 bars
- L-shaped (left AND right)
- s- shaped (left AND right)


rotations: build a matrix for each piece?
[0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,1],
[0,0,0,0]

=========================
game/controller:
single game loop interval with the following: 
- falling piece moves down by one block
- when a piece stops, a new one is built at the top of the board

var Game = function() {

  init: function() {
   // initialize grid
   // create block
   // render
  }

  function Game() {
    
  }
}

startMoving = function() {
  setInterval(someFunction(), globalInterval)
}

stopMoving = function() {
  clearInterval(someFunction())
}


=========================
block/pieces model:

- has shape, velocity, possible rotations
- moves as a unit
- createPiece()
- movePiece()


function Block() {
  this.coords = [x,y];
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}


=========================
view:

render() shows all blocks


event listeners for:
- moving a piece left or right (but not past the edge)

(more advanced:)
- tapping the down arrow jumps the piece down until something stops it
- space bar to rotate
